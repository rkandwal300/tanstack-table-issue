Issue - Table cell which is Combobox causing infinite render.

As per doc- 
1)We have Memoize column and data both, 
2) All the components inside column are created seprate component outside table.

Issue -
-We have table cell which is combobox. Combobox has search input and options.
-When we type anything in search input, using nexth js server action, we get options from backend. 
- So after typing every letter, options are changing, which cause table re-renders.

Below is sandbox Link.
We are stuck with the issue since last 3 days, we appreciate any help.
Thanks in Advance.
